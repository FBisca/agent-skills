"""The typed route schema: which backend, model and effort each model class runs on.

The driver used to read its classes from the "Model classes" table of `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`. That table is
still read — it is the legacy config, kept for a transition — but a run may name a route config instead: a
versioned document that says what each class runs on. The schema is strict on purpose: an unknown backend or
an unknown class is an error, never a silent fall back to another billable model.

The schema is a plain dict, so the file format stays a separate question: JSON is read here, YAML when
PyYAML is installed. The rules below are the same either way.

A run finds its config in the plan's order: the file it names, then the repository's own policy, then the user's
default. A command line may override one class outright (`--route small=codex/gpt-s@high`); the override is
validated like a config route and wins over every file. With no config at all the legacy table answers.
