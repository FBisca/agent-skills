"""Per-attempt evidence: one schema-versioned record per attempt, and the old metrics.json it does not replace.

`<run>/attempts.jsonl` holds one JSON object per attempt: what the attempt was (task, unit, harness, provider, source
revision), when it ran (started, finished, elapsed), how it ended (outcome, verified completion, gate outcomes) and
what it cost (retries, tool loops, interventions, human rescues, input/output/cached tokens).

Two rules hold everywhere. A measurement that was not taken is `null`, never `0`: an unknown cost is not a free
attempt. And every record names the schema it was written under, so a reader can tell what it is looking at.

The old `metrics.json` keeps its shape: the evidence is written beside it, never folded into it, so the consumers
that read `metrics.json` today keep working. Stdlib only.
