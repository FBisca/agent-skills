"""The run's append-only event log, and the metrics rolled up from it.

`<run>/events.jsonl` holds one JSON object per line: `at`, `kind`, and the fields that kind carries. A line is written
(one `write`, then `fsync`) before the driver takes its next step, so a crash loses at most the line being written.
`rollup` is a pure function of the lines: `metrics.json` can always be rebuilt from the log. Stdlib only.

Kinds the driver writes today: `start`, `import` (a run dir written by the previous version), `state` (a unit's gate or
ledger status changed), `intent` and `agent` (an agent is about to be started / is bound), `stop`, `finding`,
`round` (a failed gate), `escalation` (a unit raised a request for the Lead), `attention` (a unit paused), `decision`, `usage`,
`idle` (a loop iteration that made no progress), `error`, `wake` (a line for the Lead was written to `wakes.jsonl`),
`held`, `held-acted` and `held-dropped` (a worker message that arrived while its unit had an open request), `finish`
(the run ended; `orchestrate.py await` reads it), `contract-error` (a handoff file broke its contract: `where`, `error`),
`clarification` (an agent listed a question in `clarifications[]`: `finding`, `asked_by`, `note`, `source`), `answers`
(the implementer was resumed for the answer_required items of a passing review), `response` (one per answered finding),
`scope` (a re-review's blocking item outside the delta, about no earlier finding, was deferred: `id`, `file`),
`swap` (an agent below the context reserve was replaced by a fresh one: `name`, `role`, `remaining_tokens`) and
`context` (`context: unknown`: no usable usage measurement, so the agent was resumed).
`ci` (a pull request's checks were polled: `unit`, `task`, `gate`, `state` green|pending|none|failed, `pr`),
`draft` (a pull request was put back to a draft: `unit`, `task`, `pr`, `outcome`),
`update-branch` (a pull request behind its base was updated, or it conflicted: `unit`, `task`, `pr`, `outcome`),
`merged-early` (a pull request was merged while its unit was still working: `unit`, `task`, `pr`, `findings`) and
`idle` (a unit that showed nothing new at an idle tick: `unit`, `task`, `waiting` agent|ci, `ticks`)."""
