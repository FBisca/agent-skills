"""A bounded benchmark runner: every run gets a budget, and a run that overruns it is terminated and recorded.

S3: WHEN a test run stalls or exceeds a declared budget, THEN the benchmark terminates it and records a failure
instead of running indefinitely.

The runner starts the command in its own process group, so the whole tree (the driver, the fakes it calls, the
commands they run) dies with it: a stall costs the budget, never the suite. Every run leaves one record: the
outcome, the reason, the budget it ran under and the source revision it ran on.
