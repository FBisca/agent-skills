"""The baseline regressions: an end-to-end dispatch -> edit -> verification -> completion run, and the budget that
stops a run that stalls.

S0: WHEN a known orchestration failure is reproduced on an isolated fixture, THEN the test fails before the repair
and passes afterwards under the same fixed acceptance criteria; only a deterministic validator marks the source
revision verified. The failure reproduced here is the report timing one: the worker writes its report and its turn
ends (`runtime state idle`) before the runtime delivers the completion message. The driver must not park the ticket
as `ended without a report` and ask a human for a decision about a report it already has.

S3: WHEN a test run stalls or exceeds a declared budget, THEN the benchmark terminates it and records a failure
instead of running indefinitely.

Everything runs on the offline fixture: the fake runtime and the fake `gh` answer in process, and the driver runs
under `bench.run_budgeted`, so a stalled run is killed with its whole process group and leaves a record behind.
