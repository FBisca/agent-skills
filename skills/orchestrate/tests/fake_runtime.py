"""The fake agent-runtime: the runtime the driver talks to, answered in process.

The driver asks the runtime through one seam (`runtime_process` in `orchestrate.py`), so the tests answer it here
instead of starting a process per call. The executable the fixture puts on PATH is a wrapper around this module: one
contract, two ways to reach it.

The state lives in files under `FAKE_RUNTIME_HOME`, so a run can be scripted before it starts and read after it ends:
`calls.jsonl` (every call), `waits.json` (the scripted wait steps), `states.json` (the agents' states), `refuse.json`
(the names the runtime refuses to spawn), `stopped.json` (the names the driver stopped) and `assignments.json` (the
assignment ids each agent was given).

A wait step may name the agents it reports for: `agents` lists the agents the runtime still holds open, `complete`
lists the agents that finished their turn with a `complete` message, and `runtime_state` is the state the runtime
observed for them (`idle` when the turn ended without a message). The ids come from the assignments the runtime gave
out, so a step keeps naming the right agent after a resume.
