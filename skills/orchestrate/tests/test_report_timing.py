"""The report timing: a worker that writes its report and whose turn ends before the runtime says so.

S0: WHEN a known orchestration failure is reproduced on an isolated fixture, THEN the test fails before repair and
passes afterwards under the same fixed acceptance criteria. The failure is the report timing one: the report is on
disk, the runtime says the turn ended (`runtime state idle`), and the driver parks the ticket as `ended without a
report` and asks a human about a report it already has. After the repair the driver reads the report and moves on;
a turn that ended with no report at all still needs the Lead.
